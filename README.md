# keymonitoring-project

"""


This is a fun little project I worked on to have a better understanding of keyloggers and how they function.


Functions:
1. This script listen to keys typed by the user and gives you a timestamp on when it's pressed along with what they typed individually.
2. It scans the system to give you information on what the victim's private and public ip, broadcast ip, partitions, hardware, etc.
3. Grabs information from users' clipboard
4. Sends the files created via email
